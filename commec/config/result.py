"""
Set of containers for storing information important to screen
 outputs. Information is stored as a structure of dataclasses, and are
 converted between the dataclass / dict / json_file as required (using json.py module).

 The "annotations" dictionary, present in the HitResult,
 contains non-structured information, and is populated with differing information
 under differing keys depending on which step the information
 is derived (Biorisk, Taxonomy etc)

 In this way, the Results object serves as a common state, that can be updated
 whilst not being temporally appended like a log file i.e. .screen file.

 The Result all pertinent output information of a run.

 A Screen is made up of several Queries,
 which are made up of hits.
 Each hit derives from a Step, and has an associated recommendation.
 The Query's recommendation is the result of parsing all hitResults recommendations.

 ScreenResult:
     [QueryResult]
         recommendation (per query)
         [HitResult]:
